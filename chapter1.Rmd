# About the project

*Ruminations about the Introduction to Open Data Science (IODS) 2021*

## Feelings

The course `Introduction to Open Data Science (IODS)` feels like a good introduction 
to the __R-Rstudio-git__ pipeline advocating for reproducible well-documented research.

Challenges may arise due to

  * various backgrounds of the students
  * technological hurdles

## Outcomes

I hope the course will generate mindsets favoring *open research* equipped
with _technical skills_ to produce good research output.

I hope to learn not only technical skills but also ways to endorse 
open data science. 

## Where to find the course

I found the course in Sisu. Apparently it is also found in 
the [MOOC](https://mooc.helsinki.fi) platform.

## Repo

A fork of the course can be found at my [repo](https://github.com/evgrazhda/IODS-project).
